# CVE-Builder
[![Code Health](https://landscape.io/github/certuk/cve-builder/master/landscape.svg?style=flat)](https://landscape.io/github/certuk/cve-builder/master)

CVE Builder script that generates STIX Exploit Targets.

The script will look at the first parameter as the CVE number and uses the ares module (https://github.com/mrsmn/ares), to provide data from https://cve.circl.lu/. This provides a quick and easy method of prototyping the core information from publicly available CVE information into a STIX package. There is additional functionality to then ingest these using an API (Native TAXII coming soon).

Full warning this script is still a work in progress and is by no means a one stop shop to build a fully featured exploit target in STIX. Your own mileage may vary.

## Setup
Before using the script you will need setup the config file with your own settings:

1. Make a copy of the `config.json.template` file and rename it to `config.json`.
2. Enter your own settings inside your `config.json` file.
  * The `coas` key defines any COAs you would like to relate to your ET object.
  * The `ttp` key defines if you want TTP objects to be built as part of the package.
  * The `stix` key defines your namespace and prefix.
  * The `ingest` key defines settings related to API ingestion.

Once setup your file should look like this:
```JSON
{
  "coas": [
    {
      "id": "avengers:coa-0c6e0337-18bc-4f58-a712-5fd743565180"
    }
  ],
  "ingest": [
    {
      "active": false,
      "endpoint": "http://kb.avengers.com/adapter/certuk_mod/import/",
      "user": "bot"
    }
  ],
  "stix": [
    {
      "ns": "http://avengers.com",
      "ns_prefix": "avengers"
    }
  ],
  "ttp": false
}
```


## Usage
From a terminal/command prompt you can use the `-h` option to get an output of the available arguments.
```
$ python cvebuilder.py -h
usage: cvebuilder.py [-h] [-i ID] [-l]

Search for a CVE ID and return a STIX formatted response.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -i ID, --id ID  Enter the CVE ID that you want to grab
  -l, --last      Pulls down and converts the latest 30 CVEs
```

To get a single CVE ID returned you would use the following command.

```
$ python cvebuilder.py -i CVE-2015-5119
```

Or if you wanted to get the last 30 CVE IDs.

```
$ python cvebuilder.py -l
```

Both of these commands will either output to STIX xml in the current directory or use the ingestion API if you have this enabled in the `config.json` file.

Or you can use it as a module within your own script.
```python
from cve-builder import cveSearch

result = cveSearch("CVE-2015-5119")
print(cveSearch)

```

## Example Output
An example output can be found in the [Example](Example-Package-7cbc9064-8662-4fca-8b1e-4bdc3d32e0a7.xml) file. This example uses CVE-2015-5119.
